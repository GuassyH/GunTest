This asset was created by Gustav Haag

To use this asset you need a few things.
First of all create a new layer called Interactable and set all Interactable objects to it and set the "Interactable layer" in the Player Camera to the layer.
 
Every script that is Interactable should be added into the "Interactable Scripts" Field in the Player Camera and all interactable scripts have to have a bool saying " isHeld "
